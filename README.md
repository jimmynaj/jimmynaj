- Hi, I’m @jimmynaj. 
- Currently pushing myself to be in IT/Digital space without CS background.
- I'm placing my bet on web development, cloud computing and IT project management.
- For web development, Git Hub will be my main playground.
- Been following https://www.theodinproject.com/ to learn HTML, CSS and Java Script.
- You can reach me on twitter @jimmynaj and I'm looking forward to meet all the like-minded people!
